# Bus Stop Optimization Project

## Project Description
This is a data analysis project aimed at optimizing the bus routes in Wenzhou City.

## Data file
- `populaiton/Wenzhou_population_grid.csv` - Wenzhou City Population Grid Data
- `Bus Stop shp/` - Wenzhou City Public Transport Stop Spatial Data Folder
  - `0577Wenzhou.shp` - The main spatial data files
  - Other supporting documents: `.cpg`, `.dbf`, `.prj`, `.sbn`, `.sbx`, `.shx`

## System requirements
Windows 10 and above

## Work Flow Description

### Important: Code Execution Rules
**All the code in this project is not executed directly in Claude! **

When it is necessary to execute the code:
1. Claude will clearly indicate the specific file or command that needs to be run.
2. The user runs the code manually in the IDE.
3. If there are errors, the user copies the error information to Claude for analysis and repair.

### Development Process
1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
2. Spatial Data Analysis
3. Development of Bus Network Optimization Algorithm
4. Result Visualization and Report Generation

## Technology Stack
- Python for Data Analysis
- Spatial Data Processing (GeoPandas, GDAL, etc.)
- Network Analysis and Optimization Algorithms
